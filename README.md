*The plan was to make the black circles rotatate and each of them would represent a month. The circle at the middle would be the display option for the selected month along with the QR code for spotify. I made them a solid color cause i couldn't find a clip art that would fit the theme.

*The circle and the most played are not responsive beacause it's really hard to positon those. There is no free grid chrome extention.

*I also wanted to make the logo size bigger but the resolution would be messed up
